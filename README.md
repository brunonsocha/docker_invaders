# Docker Invaders

## Description
This is a fork of the [env_tester](https://github.com/brunonsocha/env_tester) project, a tool to test containers by killing them, restarting them and measuring the recovery time.

While it was very fun to write, it's very boring to watch. This project is supposed to help with that.

Shoot at your containers, kill them and watch them ~~restart~~ respawn. At the end, you'll be presented with stats and an option to download detailed data in .csv format.
